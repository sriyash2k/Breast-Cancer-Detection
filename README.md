# breast-cancer-detection
Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data<br/>
<br/>
Detect stage of cancer from benign or malignant.<br/>
Best 93.96% accuracy by DecisionTreeClassifier of scikit learn.<br/>
96% accuracy by simple 1 hidden layer neural net. Trained with 100 epochs. Having more hidden layers may increase accuracy a little. But it may not generalize and <b>overfit</b> the train data.<br /><br/>
Tried several models on the same dataset. I have also tried ensambling of several models, but it turns out that simple DecisionTreeClassifier beats them.
